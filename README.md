# Algerian Forest Fire Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the analysis of the Algerian forest fire dataset. The aim is to process and clean the dataset, generate visualizations, and derive insights by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI). This analysis utilizes multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization models, including cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The project also involves saving the models as pickle files for future use and testing the model on unseen data.
